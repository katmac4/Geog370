    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>I used a point to represent Shell Island resort, a structure that was threatened by migrating Mason Inlet in 2002. A rough outline of the 2002 inlet boundary is shown with a vector line and the current inlet hazard area is represented by a polygon. Land tracts are shown through vector data over the open street map provided by QGIS.</p>
